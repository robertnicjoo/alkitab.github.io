Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things. Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves: Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen. For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature: And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.

Kalau Saudara ingin supaya Saudara tidak merasa takut terhadap pemerintah, Saudara harus berbuat baik, maka Saudara akan dipuji.Sebab pemerintah adalah hamba Allah yang bekerja untuk kebaikanmu. Tetapi kalau Saudara berbuat jahat, memang Saudara harus takut kepadanya, sebab bukannya sia-sia saja ia berkuasa untuk menghukum orang. Ia adalah hamba Allah, yang menjatuhkan hukuman Allah kepada orang-orang yang berbuat jahat.Itu sebabnya Saudara harus taat kepada pemerintah--bukan hanya karena Saudara tidak mau dihukum, tetapi juga karena suara hati nuranimu.Itulah juga alasannya mengapa Saudara membayar pajak, sebab pemerintah adalah pegawai Allah yang menjalankan tugas yang khusus ini.Jadi bayarlah kepada pemerintah apa yang Saudara harus bayar kepadanya. Bayarlah pajak, kalau Saudara harus membayar pajak; dan bayarlah cukai kalau Saudara harus membayar cukai. Hargailah mereka yang harus dihargai dan hormatilah mereka yang harus dihormati.
